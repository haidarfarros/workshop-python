<b>4.1 Python Conditions and If statements</b><p>
Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:<p>
Equals: a == b<p>
Not Equals: a != b<p>
Less than: a < b<p>
Less than or equal to: a <= b<p>
Greater than: a > b<p>
Greater than or equal to: a >= b<p>

<b>4.2 Python For Loops</b><p>
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).<p>
This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.<p>
With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

<b>4.3 The range() Function</b><p>
The range() is an in-built function in Python. It returns a sequence of numbers starting from zero and increment by 1 by default and stops before the given number. ... step: It's also an optional parameter used to specify the incrementation on each iteration; by default, the value is one<p>
  
<b>4.4. break and continue Statements, and else Clauses on Loops</b><p>
Loops in Python<p>
for loop<p>
while loop<p>
Letâ€™s learn how to use control statements like break, continue, and else clauses in the for loop and the while loop.<p>
for loop = break > continue > else clause<p>
while loop = continue > break > else clause<p>
